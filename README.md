# Advent of Code 2024

Implementation of the solutions for the Advent of Code challenge in Standard ML.

## How to run

Each day expects to find the files "small.txt" and "large.txt" with the example small input and the full problem input.

**SML/NJ**: `sml sources` to load main.sml to the REPL. `Main.main ();` to run the solutions.

**MLton**: `mlton lib.mlb` to produce an executable file. `./lib` to run the program.
